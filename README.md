# Semaphore
Every second it is necessary to pull a random number from the service from the previous link with an ajax request.
The obtained number needs to be converted into binary form, in eight-bit format, so to speak
the number 105 represented in binary form is 01101001, and for example the number 1 is represented by
00000001.
The binary form of the number should be displayed on the page so that the zeros are represented by a red circle,
the units should be a green circle, the period while waiting for a new value is shown with 8 yellow ones
circles
